## Installation

Copy code over to your machine and in the terminal run the command npm start to get the correct databases.

## Usage

In insomnia or any back end app a user can use get methods to call the users or thoughts, users can also user post, delete and update calls to the server. With each user they can add a friend by calling the user route and the user's id they want to be friends with. Its the same with the delete friend method where a user input the user's id and the friends id to delete. The reactions to thougths work the same.
